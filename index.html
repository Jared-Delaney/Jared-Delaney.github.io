	</h1>
	<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="5">
		I was born and raised in the Bronx as a Afro-Latino, I was raised by both of my parents and have 2 siblings. I plan on going to a college in or out of state after graduating highschool. I was always hesitant about going to college but I realized college will help me not hurt me. I am interested in studying business and hoping to start my own business by 21.

   		<td> In this piece I changed the filer and color of my photo. I changed the colors on this image from orange and black from blue and black. I also changed the photo from looking realistic to looking pixelated.</td>
   		<td> This piece I chose my favorite flower and transformed it into a mandela. This design was really challenging and time consuming because I needed to repeat steps to create the Mandela. </td>
   		<td> This piece was inspired by where I was born and grew up. I combined 4 different pictures from New York with 3 words saying "Born and Raised". I like this project because it is simple and shows where im from.</td>
